# Casting
The aim of this project was to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying metal casting images. A comprehensive dataset of metal casting images was collected, and a series of preprocessing steps were applied to enhance the accuracy and generalization of the model. These steps included resizing, normalizing, and augmenting the images.
Upon completion of training and validation, the CNN model achieved an impressive accuracy of 85% on the test set. This outcome underscores the effectiveness of CNN models for image classification tasks, particularly in the context of metal casting analysis. The successful development of this model has significant implications for various industries, including manufacturing, quality control, and industrial automation.
This project demonstrates the efficacy of a CNN model for metal casting image classification. With further refinements and integration into industry-specific systems, this model can have far-reaching applications in areas such as foundries, metallurgical research, and quality control departments, ultimately driving advancements in the field of metal casting analysis.
